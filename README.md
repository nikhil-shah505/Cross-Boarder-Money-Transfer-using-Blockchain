# Cross-Boarder-Money-Transfer-using-Blockchain
An attempt to address this issue has been made from the standpoint of introducing an additional  DATA Layer along the payment process chain including the blockchain. The regulatory and  compliance requirements around transaction details for due transaction monitoring or confirming  the details of the originator and recipient for FATF or 'sanction screening' can be implemented  using the DATA Layer. Because the network is transparent, the number of suspicious  transactions for AML and transactions through 'high risk countries' could be reduced.
